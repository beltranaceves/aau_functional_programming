# Session 3: Types and classes; static and dynamic typing – 23 September 2025 2:30 pm

- Haskell is a statically typed programming language and in order to understand what this gives us, it is important to understand the difference between static and dynamic type disciplines.  
- The type system of Haskell is very expressive and mastering it is highly important when it comes to writing Haskell programs. In this session we will have a first look at the type system and its important notions of polymorphism and overloading (also known as parametric polymorphism and ad hoc polymorphism); these two notions often go together. In Haskell, overloading is described using the important notion of type classes. A type class is a family of types.  
- The λ-calculus is the model of computation that is the basis of functional programming. Every functional programming language is really just a version of the lambda calculus. The implementation of functional programming languages is based on the syntax, semantics and type systems of the λ-calculus, so it is important to understand it to understand the functional paradigm.

## Learning goals  
*(the learning goals for Haskell and the theoretical foundations for this session are not related)*

### Haskell:
- To be able to explain and use the central notions of types in Haskell – basic types, list types, function types and tuple types  
- To be able to explain and use curried and uncurried functions and how these notions relate to higher-order functions  
- To be able to explain and use the notion of type classes  
- To be able to explain the notions of polymorphism and overloading (parametric and ad hoc-polymorphism), the difference between them and the relationship to type classes  

### The theoretical foundations:
- To understand and to be able to explain the difference between static and dynamic typing  
- To be able to explain and use the syntax and reduction semantics of the pure lambda-calculus  
- To be able to explain why renaming of bound variables is a necessary notion
